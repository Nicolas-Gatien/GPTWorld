# GPTWORLD

This repository hosts the code for a unique project implementing an autonomous chatbot that interacts within a game world. The chatbot is designed using GPT-3 and it is not only capable of deciding its own movements but also expresses its inner thoughts.

## Project Overview

This project is comprised of three core parts:

1. **Game Map Initialization:** A game world is set up that contains different elements like paths, walls, and water bodies. The autonomous player, symbolized by the character 'C', is also initialized in this map.

2. **Autonomous Chatbot Creation:** A chatbot, powered by GPT-3, is constructed. This chatbot is capable of deciding its own actions in the game world and shares its thought process while making these decisions.

3. **Game Loop:** A continuous game loop is established, during which the chatbot decides its moves. Based on these decisions, the game state is updated and the visual display is refreshed accordingly.

## Game Objective

The main objective of this game is for the chatbot to navigate the path through the game world autonomously. As the chatbot moves and decides, it shares its inner thoughts which in turn brings more depth to its actions and the overall game experience.
